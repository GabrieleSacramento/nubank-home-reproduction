# Nubank Reproduction

My ideia for Nubank Reproduction was pratice with the Nubank home page layout, made api integrations and learn about build themes that work dynamically. This app is very important to me because here i was able to put into practice important concepts about build a flutter app.

## Requirements 

- Dart SDK version: 3.1.2
- Flutter SDK version: 3.19.3

## This class uses:

- Clean Architecture as architecture
- Cubit as state management
- Apiary as API mock

## Authors

- Gabriele Sacramento
